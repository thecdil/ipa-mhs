## About the Exhibit 

This exhibit is an extension of Idaho Public Archaeology (IPA) and the University of Idaho (UI), an organization run by UI Anthropology faculty (Drs. Katrina Eichner, Mark Warner, and Renae Campbell) that emphasizes public engagement in archaeology. The exhibit was built by UI anthropology graduate student Massey Jordan as part of the fulfillment of the requirements for a Masters in Anthropology. 

## Acknowledgements 

This exhibit could not be possible without PIs Drs. Katrina Eichner, Mark Warner, and Renae Campbell. Additionally, the exhibit would not exist without the work and assistance of Evan Williamson at the UI Library Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL).
