## Imagine

Imagine your high school, or a high school you’ve visited before. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="ipa-mhs-057;ipa-mhs-027;ipa-mhs-070" %}

Keep these memories in your mind. As you look at MHS spaces and the objects left behind, think about how your memories are different or similar to the spaces students and teacher moved through at MHS in both the past and the present. 

## Whitworth School

{% include feature/image.html objectid="ipa-mhs-015" %} 

Take a look at Moscow’s first high school, the Whitworth School, built in 1892. 

What do you notice? Perhaps you see the towers, the large windows, or the gothic architecture. 

How do you think the Whitworth School fit in with other Idaho schools in the 1890s?

Turns out, the Whitworth School was following the trends of the day for Idaho schools! Its iconic towers, eerie gothic style, and even the large windows were all the rage in Idaho school buildings from the 1890s into the 1910s. 

This means that Moscow’s high school students between 1892 and 1912 (when a new high school was built) moved through their school in a way that was specific to Idaho during this time.

While it’s important to keep in mind that the Whitworth School remained in use by lower grades until 1939 and was changed over the years, how do you think students between 1892 and 1912 experienced moving through their beloved high school? 

## Bricks

It’s no secret that the current MHS building, particularly the first section built in 1939, is made of bricks. As was the first MHS, the Whitworth School! 

Our memories from inside our schools are strong, and to this day, people actually care enough to go on tours of an old classroom inside the second (1912) MHS building. 

So, what was (and is) life like inside and outside the brick building of MHS? 

## Windows 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="mhs-23-05112.1a" %} 

These broken pieces of glass may look quite boring; what’s so great about glass?

This glass is from a window, and likely ended up in the ground from it breaking, or from the building it belonged to being destroyed. 

This window glass was excavated from the courtyard of the current MHS building, near where the old Whitworth School once stood. This means that students today are walking through spaces that once were part of the landscape of the Whitworth School.

It’s around 1940 and you’re enjoying your junior year in the brand new and exciting MHS building! 

You spend the day rushing around to your classes: history, English, and even shop. You walk into shop class, which is housed in a large sunlit room. The first thing you notice amongst the various mechanical contraptions your classmates are working on is the windows: big, bright, illuminating the dust in the air.
