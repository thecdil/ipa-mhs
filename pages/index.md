# Moscow High School, It’s History, and It’s Archaeology

## Moscow High School

Think about some of the most formative experiences of your life - many of them might have to do with education, whatever form it may take. Learning new things is how we grow, and for the town of Moscow, Idaho, Moscow High School (MHS) is a place where so much of the community learned many of the lessons they carry with them today.

Built in 1892, the first Moscow High School was known as the Whitworth School. In 1912, a new high school building was built across the street and is still standing today as a beloved community center. The current Moscow High School was built in 1939 where the Whitworth School once stood.

## Archaeology at MHS

Faculty at MHS wanted to learn more about student life through time. So, Idaho Public Archaeology (IPA) at the University of Idaho teamed up with the school to do some digs at MHS. IPA archaeologists and University of Idaho students conducted those digs to learn more about student life and the history of the MHS property.

## What is Archaeology?

It’s more than just digging in the ground! Archaeologists use the stuff left behind by people in the past to learn more about human behavior.

## The Online Exhibit

This exhibit serves as a tool for the Moscow community to interact with a shared heritage. This exhibit uses stories from Moscow community members, archival records, and archaeology to explore experiences at MHS over time.
