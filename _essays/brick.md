Itâ€™s no secret that the current MHS building, particularly the first section built in 1939, is made of bricks. As was the first MHS, the Whitworth School! 

Our memories from inside our schools are strong, and to this day, people actually care enough to go on tours of an old classroom inside the second (1912) MHS building. 

So, what was (and is) life like inside and outside the brick building of MHS?
