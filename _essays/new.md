It’s around 1940 and you’re enjoying your junior year in the brand new and exciting MHS building! 

You spend the day rushing around to your classes: history, English, and even shop. You walk into shop class, which is housed in a large sunlit room. The first thing you notice amongst the various mechanical contraptions your classmates are working on is the windows: big, bright, illuminating the dust in the air.
