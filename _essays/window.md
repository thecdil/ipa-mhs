These broken pieces of glass may look quite boring; whatâ€™s so great about glass? 

This glass is from a window, and likely ended up in the ground from it breaking, or from the building it belonged to being destroyed. 

This window glass was excavated from the courtyard of the current MHS building, near where the old Whitworth School once stood. This means that students today are walking through spaces that once were part of the landscape of the Whitworth School.
