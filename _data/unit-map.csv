map-001,Unit 3,46.7321364497819,-116.997614914339,"Perhaps the most interesting unit to the public, this unit revealed part of the foundations of the 1892 Whitworth School, the first Moscow High School! While archaeologists mostly found architectural debris (mortar, brick, etc.), recovering the 1892 foundations of the first MHS proved to be important and intriguing to site visitors and high school tour groups.",ipa-mhs-090;mhs-23-00260,"Here you can see a portion of the foundations of the 1892 Whitworth School, or the first Moscow High School. The half-moon shape indicates it was part of one of the two towers on the facade of the school building, though archaeologists don’t yet know whether it was the eastern or western tower.; This object might look quite familiar. Of the few artifacts found in this unit, most of them were recent synthetic items like this buckle fragment. Perhaps this is the remnant of a broken backpack, and thus a frustrating day for a busy MHS student."
map-002,Unit 21,46.7313616298305,-116.997879258957,"Want to know what people in Moscow in the early 20th century were eating? Look no further than Unit 21. Dense amounts of butchered animal bones alongside fascinating household materials were found by archaeologists here, giving us a glimpse into the everyday diet and life of these past nearby households. Looking at butchered faunal remains tells us what meat types and cuts people were consuming, which in turn informs us about many things, such as economic status. The household items show us what their interior homes may have looked like and what items held meaning and use for them.",ipa-mhs-121;mhs-23-03450,"Here you can see one of the butchered animal bones sticking out of the unit wall, an illustration of the alleyway’s use prior to the modern day.; This lipstick container once held Coty lipstick, manufactured by a French cosmetics brand created in 1904 and still owning other brands today. Similar brass containers like this one were popular during the 1960s. It acts as an example of the personal and household items found in Area 3 in the 2019 and 2023 MHS digs."
map-003,Unit 6,46.7322926174073,-116.996791408615,"Located right along the edge of the sidewalk that lines Third Street to the northeast of the current MHS building, Unit 6 proved to also be a great locale to engage with passersby. This unit didn’t recover many of the intriguing artifacts that others did, however, a bit of rotting wood was discovered in a lower layer of the unit. Could this be the remnant of a past wooden shed or building? Archaeologists are still trying to answer that question, but take a look at some of the things we found.",ipa-mhs-120;mhs-23-02791,"Here you can see the north wall of Unit 6, where a dark area in the soil indicates the rotting wood that archaeologists found in the unit.; This barrel key likely opened something small and personal, or a household item such as a cabinet. To futher explore this key's possible role in the history of Moscow, please visit our ""Life at MHS"" page and follow the ""Lost and Broken Things"" exhibit."
map-004,Unit 8,46.73213239235,-116.997847937375,"This unit was placed at the very edge of the frontmost area of the MHS dig, Area 1. A small unit that became even smaller after an irrigation pipe was discovered, this unit was placed due to some architectural materials being found and the hope that archaeologists would find some evidence of a playground that is remembered in local legend. While little was found to support that the playground was in this direct vicinity, some architectural materials and an ash deposit was recovered here. Take a look!",mhs-23-00382,"Found close to the surface of Unit 8, these bits of plaster are a part of the architectural changes that have happened on the property over time, including the destruction of the old Whitworth School, the construction of the current MHS, and the additions of the two MHS annexes.; This plastic whistle indicates additional student, or possibly children's, use of the MHS property, perhaps attached to a backpack by someone who attended MHS."
map-005,Unit 14,46.7316579977226,-116.997020590559,"This unit is located in what is the courtyard of the MHS building. This unit was placed near the staircase of the courtyard entrance, which once served as the main entrance for the school. Now, the courtyard area is commonly used as a lunch spot. The unit yielded many more recent materials related to high school student life and activities, such as food wrappers and school supplies, with lower layers including mostly architectural materials. This is consistent with archaeologists’ knowledge of the area and the many school buildings and additions that have existed on the property through time.",mhs-23-05110;mhs-23-05112,"Found close to the surface of Unit 14, these brick fragments indicate the architectural changes that have happened on the property over time, including the destruction of the old Whitworth School, the construction of the current MHS, and the additions of the two MHS annexes.; Similar to the brick fragments found in Unit 14, these flat glass fragments illustrate a remnant of physical spaces. These fragments were once part of windows, likely of one of the school buildings. This gives us a glimpse into how students may have experienced the school day, navigating places where natural light is let in."
map-006,Unit 23,46.7314836330848,-116.997884606497,"Unit 23 was opened adjacent to a unit that had been previously opened in 2019. Unit 23 proved to hold large amounts of evidence that Area 3 had once been used as an alleyway where trash was deposited by nearby residents. Many clear ash layers and deposits were recovered, holding horseshoe nails, ceramic and glass artifacts, clothing hardware, animal bone, and more.",mhs-23-03711;mhs-23-02747,"This small object is a hook and eye clasp, usually used to close delicate clothing. However, they’ve also historically been used to clasp coats and heavier items. This very well could have been a staple in someone’s closet who lived nearby, and if they were a student or teacher, perhaps it even adorned the clothes they wore to and from school.; This little bit of container glass has a purple hue to it. Why do you think this is? Is the coloring intentional? Fascinatingly, this indicates that this glass was made using manganese as an ingredient. Once exposed to the sun, manganese will slowly cause the glass to turn more and more purple in hue. Manganese glass was produced in America as late as 1930."
