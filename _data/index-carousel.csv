ipa-mhs-060,,Graduating Class,"Pictured is a MHS graduating class, most likely the class of 1903. You can see that in 1903, class size was much smaller than it is today. What else looks different from today?",,,
ipa-mhs-026,,Industrial Arts Class,"In this photo, snapped in 1940, we see students hard at work in an industrial arts class. These appear to be high school students, thus the building they’re in is likely the new MHS building in 1939.",Student Life,/ipa-mhs/life.html,
ipa-mhs-025,,Play,"Taken the year after the new high school building was built, here we see students in 1940 playing outside the new and exciting MHS. While the age and/or grade level of these students is unknown, they appear to be lower grade students taking advantage of the new space.

ipa-mhs-055,,Entrance,"Two students bean at the camera, standing in front of the Moscow High School entrance sometime in the 1980s. This is Andrew Martin and Kari (?)

ipa-mhs-058,,Artifacts,"The artifacts found at MHS are really just objects; things people have used, made, or owned in the past and even into the present. Pictured here are some of the objects archaeologists found in the ground at MHS. Objects such as these, as mundane as they may seem, sparked incredible stories from community members about school and general life in Moscow in the past and through to the present. These stories guided the construction of this exhibit, so explore the knowledge shared by the people of Moscow for the people of Moscow.",,,
